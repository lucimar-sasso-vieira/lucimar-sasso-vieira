## Hi, I'm Lucimar Sasso Vieira ðŸ‘‹
OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I graduated in Computer Science and PhD in Computational Physics with a focus on audio and voice data analysis where I developed artificial neural network algorithms. I've worn many hats in my career: developer, systems analyst, university professor, data analyst, data engineering and business intelligence and analytics consultant.

Currently I am working as a Data Engineering at OAK Tecnologia, allocated into a customer team. The tech stack I am currently working with is Power BI, PostgreSQL, Python, Pandas, Numpy and Microsoft Fabric, but I also have experience working on projects built with Apache Hop and Pentaho. Regarding databases, I have worked mostly with PostgreSQL and Oracle but also made some projects using My SQL and SQL Server.
